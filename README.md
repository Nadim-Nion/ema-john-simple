# Ema John Shopping Cart


---

**Project Name:** My Second React App 

**Description:**
This is my second React App, where I've leveraged HTML5 for structuring and plain CSS for designing. React.js has been instrumental in helping me write efficient code and create a dynamic user experience.

**Key Features:**

1. **API Integration:** I've seamlessly integrated an API to fetch detailed product information, providing users with up-to-date data.

2. **Interactive Cart:** Users can add products to their cart with a single click. The number of items in the cart is dynamically updated and displayed in the UI, enhancing the shopping experience.

3. **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive across various devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile. I've utilized plain CSS for responsiveness, and in the future, I plan to incorporate CSS frameworks to further enhance compatibility across all devices.

**Technologies Used:**
- React.js
- HTML5
- Plain CSS

**Future Enhancements:**
I'm committed to continuously improving this project. Future plans include implementing CSS frameworks to ensure optimal responsiveness across a wide range of devices.

Feel free to explore the code and contribute to the development of this exciting project!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
